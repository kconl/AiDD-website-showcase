				<h2>My Background</h2>
				<p>I grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where I attended Wayne High School before pursuing business and technology at Indiana University‚Äôs Kelley School of Business. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Business with majors in Information Systems and Supply Chain Management and am now completing the Master of Science in Information Systems program, graduating in 2026. My first exposure to the corporate world came at Petroleum Traders, where I gained hands-on experience across departments, supporting client communication, freight submissions, invoice balancing, and operational processes. At Fort Wayne Metals, I built on that experience by improving demand planning accuracy through advanced forecasting analysis and developing dashboards that delivered actionable insights to both technical and sales teams.</p>
				<p>More recently, I contributed to the Kelley HOPE Digital Project, collaborating with internal and external partners to develop onboarding systems and a digital marketplace. By leveraging AI tools, structured project management, and a user-driven design approach, I helped streamline development processes and deliver meaningful outcomes. Alongside academic experiences ranging from case analysis to data architecture to technical analysis, these experiences reflect my ability to bridge business objectives with technical solutions. I bring a detail-oriented, collaborative mindset to my work and remain focused on driving efficiency, enhancing user experience, and creating lasting impact.</p>
