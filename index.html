                    <p>I recently earned a B.S. in Supply Chain Management and Information Systems from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, where I developed a strong skillset in areas such as operations strategy, process optimization, data analytics, and digital design and transformation.</p>

                    <p>Through previous corporate internships and class projects, I've enhanced my understanding of the ways organizations succeed and struggle in their efforts to improve existing processes and gain a competitive edge. I have long held a professional interest in opportunities that allow me to create actionable change through incremental improvements and a principled problem-solving approach.</p>

                    <p>In the MSIS program at Kelley, I hope to deepen both the breadth and depth of my technical expertise, combining my existing knowledge of operations and technology to explore ways that organizations can make the best use of their limited resources in a dynamic and ever-changing world.</p>
